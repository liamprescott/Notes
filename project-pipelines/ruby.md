#Ruby

Ruby is the underlying platform / programming language upon which other platforms and frameworks run.

## Is Ruby needed?
Primarily Ruby is required in order to use the native version of Sass and some Sass libraries e.g. Compass.

If using LibSass (C/C++ version) of Sass then it's probably not needed.

##Installing Ruby
1. Download the latest version from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/.
2. Run installation.

    Make sure that the ***Add Ruby executables to your PATH*** option is selected.
